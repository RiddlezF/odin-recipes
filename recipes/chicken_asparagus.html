<h3>How to make Chicken asparagus</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place each chicken breast between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Place four asparagus spears down the center of each chicken breast, then top with mozzarella. Roll chicken around fillings to make tidy, compact rolls.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken, seam-side down, to the prepared baking dish. Brush chicken breasts with mayonnaise if using and sprinkle bread crumbs over top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
